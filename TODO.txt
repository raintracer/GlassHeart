Done:
Added crude leveling pathfinder function.
Add final backup command to boost if there is nothing to do.



TODO:
Add back up pathfind for leveling the tiles

OBSERVATIONS:
The AI on leveling needs to make sure there is a valid tile to move to actually perform the leveling. It constantly switching empty spaces is causing issues
